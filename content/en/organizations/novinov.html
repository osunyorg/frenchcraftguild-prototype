    <p>  <br>In a world in search of ecological renewal,  novinov  is at the crossroads of scientific research, environmental transition and artistic experimentation.  novifil , fully bio-based and biodegradable 3D printing filament, combines plant-based PLA with plant-based fibres  Miscanthus  cultivated near Fontainebleau, without artificial irrigation or chemical inputs. It offers a singular material, both technical and sensitive, to the subtly organic texture and to the golden hue revealing fine shades under the light.  novifil  invites artists, designers and artisans to explore an eco-responsible aesthetic, where precision, durability and material poetry meet in objects that bear the memory of the plant and the territory.</p>  <p> Filæ  <br>Filæ weaves light from matter. Through additive manufacturing, the filament rich in miscanthus fibres is deposited flat as a thread on a contemporary loom. This slow and precise movement gives rise to air suspensions. The economical and minimalist structure becomes the frame. The plant material captures light, revealing a soft, light and naturally golden presence. <br>Manufactured in 3D printing FDM (melted wire deposit), with the novifil PLM-20 loaded with miscanthus fibres grown in Seine-et-Marne (77)</p>
