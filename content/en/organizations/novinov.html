    <p>novinov develops innovative bio-based materials and products in France for use in 3D printing and plastics processing</p>
  body: >-
    <p>  <br>In a world in search of ecological renewal,  novinov  is at the crossroads of scientific research, environmental transition and artistic experimentation.  novifil , fully bio-based and biodegradable 3D printing filament, combines plant-based PLA with plant-based fibres  Miscanthus  cultivated near Fontainebleau, without artificial irrigation or chemical inputs. It offers a singular material, both technical and sensitive, to the subtly organic texture and to the golden hue revealing fine shades under the light.  novifil  invites artists, designers and artisans to explore an eco-responsible aesthetic, where precision, durability and material poetry meet in objects that bear the memory of the plant and the territory.</p>
