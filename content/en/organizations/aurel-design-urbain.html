  <p>Founded by Caterina and Marc Aurel, Aurel Design Urbain is an architecture and design agency born from the fusion of two creative worlds: that of light, objects, and materials, as well as that of cities and public spaces. These two complementary approaches, ranging from small to large scale, define the signature of the Aurel Design Urbain studio. Space design, furniture design, and material choices are made with the user's scale in mind.With 30 years of experience, the studio operates in the fields of lighting, furniture, and public space planning. Caterina and Marc Aurel have chosen to leverage their expertise for the benefit of the widest audience, especially in the public space, through reflections on:● The use of natural materials in connection with artisanal skills ;<br>● The use and valorization of recycled materials;<br>● The relationship between the city and nature;<br>● The quality of light in urban environments.</p>
