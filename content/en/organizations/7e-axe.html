    <p>Robotic painting on complex shapes  <br>Founded in 2023 by Jean-Marie Ollivier, 7e Axe explores the links between art and robotics. The company designs and manufactures industrial and artistic machines whose movements are inspired by human gestures. Founded by Laurent Lagarrigue, AT3L, a data consulting company, promotes data related to heritage. It transforms information into a preservation tool, facilitating the transmission and management of exceptional craftsmanship. Both engineers, one shapes matter, the other information.  Together, they embody a contemporary vision of the arts and crafts, at the crossroads of high technology and the transmission of know-how. Created for Maison Hennessy (LVMH group), this painting robot interprets works generated digitally by French artist Florian Zumbrunn on Hennessy X.O Cognac decanters. Each piece is unique, making every decanter a singular work of art. The robot's movements are calculated based on a digital model of the object, allowing for precise application of the material through faithful reproduction of human gestures.  </p>
