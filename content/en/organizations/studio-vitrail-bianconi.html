    <p>Stained glass - Monochrome composition  <br>Inspired by the geometric shapes of the 1930s, this work offers a contemporary reading of the stained glass through a palette deliberately reduced to black, white and grey.The glass surfaces - textured, lacquered, opalescent or silver - compose a set of transparencys, reflections and depths, where light becomes a matter in its own right. Designed as a wall work, this stained glass window exceeds the function of the window to read as a pictorial surface, halfway between canvas, mirror and architecture. A vision of the stained glass today, sober, graphic and luminous.</p>
