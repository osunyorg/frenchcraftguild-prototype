    <p>Collision  <br>Samuel Latour's sculptures are conceived as volumes to write, carrying an abstract language of lines and suspended gestures. The visible traces of their manufacture reflect a subtle tension between rigour and spontaneity, echoing the attention of the campus to the gesture, matter and singularity of creation. The Collision series is based on a protocol linking graphic intent and volume creation. From drawings extracted from his notebook, Samuel Latour sculpts the wood in turn by eccentric shooting. He explores the repetition, variation and composition of patterns in the defined space of the cylinder. <br>Collision n° 53 - </p>  <p>Walnut </p>  <p>- H. 63 cm Ø 10 cm Collision n°59 - </p>  <p>Walnut </p>  <p>- H. 47 Ø 9,5 cm Collision n° 62 - </p>  <p>Sycamore maple</p>  <p> - H. 59 cm Ø 9,5 cm`</p>
