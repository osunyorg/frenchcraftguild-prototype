  <p>It is during their visit to the Ateliers de Paris (2016-2018) that Aurelia Leblanc and Lucile Viaud imagine the encounter between their subjects of choice. Aurélia Leblanc weaves exceptional yarns for haute couture, Lucile Viaud develops and manufactures her own recipes of natural glasses from resources to be valued locally (geoverry).<br><br>By achieving a unique material, the weaving of glass, degrading the coloured variants of the lenses available according to the seasons, they propose the encounter between their two visions, personalities and know-how. Habited by the question of movement, the frame and the possible dialogue between glass and bio-sourced yarns, the creators thus decline to infinity their material of architectural art. The winners of the Grands Prix de la Ville de Paris (2017 and 2018) postponed in 2023 the Bettencourt Schueller Prize "Intelligence de la Main" in the category Dialogues.</p>
