    <p>Glass weaving  <br>By achieving a unique material, the weaving of glass, degrading the coloured variants of the lenses available according to the seasons, Aurélia Leblanc and Lucile Viaud propose the encounter between their two visions, personalities and know-how.  Habited by the question of movement, the frame and the possible dialogue between glass and bio-sourced yarns, the creators thus decline to infinity their material of architectural art.  The winners of the Grands Prix de la Ville de Paris (2017 and 2018) postponed in 2023 the Bettencourt Schueller Prize for Intelligence of the Main in the category Dialogues. <br>Hand-held sea glass weaving ranging from 2D to 3D on a varied range from transparency to opacity, from flexibility to rigidity, through yarn variations and integration of unique modules.</p>
