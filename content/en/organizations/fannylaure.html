    <p>Straw marquetry fixed under glass </p>  <p>This innovation, registered with the INPI (French Patent and Trademark Office), combines artisanal and industrial techniques.  The glass is tempered and then baked in an oven with the straw marquetry, creating a solid and durable laminated glass panel.  Once fixed in place, the straw marquetry takes on a new dimension: protected from discoloration, peeling, and friction, it can be used in new ways, particularly outdoors.</p>
