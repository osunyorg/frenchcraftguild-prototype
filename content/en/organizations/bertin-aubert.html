    <p>Chalice and paten of the Chapter of Notre-Dame de Paris  <br>Chalice and paten commissioned by the Chapter of Notre-Dame de Paris from young designer Julien Roos for the reopening of the cathedral. The two liturgical objects were carved from brass using CNC machining at the MMB company in Normandy, before being electroplated with palladium and subtly satin-finished by microblasting at Bertin Aubert in Paris. Inspired by Gothic architecture, the crown of thorns, and historical sacred objects, this new Eucharistic silverware seems to be animated by a vital force and is the result of a completely new design, both in terms of its design, manufacturing technique, and finish.   <br>CHALICE:  <br> Height: 31 cm  <br> Cup diameter: 10 cm  <br> Base diameter: 15 cm  <br> Material: palladium-plated brass  <br> Weight: 1540 g (Replica displayed in 3D PLA printing, filler, paint, and varnish)  <br> PATEN:  <br> Height: 3 cm  <br> Diameter: 23.2 cm  <br> Material: palladium-plated brass  <br> Weight: 930 g (Replica displayed in 3D PLA printing, filler, paint, and varnish)   </p>
