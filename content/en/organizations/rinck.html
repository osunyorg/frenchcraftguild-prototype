    <p>Chair throne Opus Memoria - first piece  <br>From the Opus Memoria collection, inspired by the atmosphere of a demiurge artist's workshop, this armchair stands out for its impressive appearance. It symbolizes and is part of a place where creativity is spreading, inviting exploration and imagination. A result of an unprecedented research work, specific attention is paid to the details and quality of the materials, to create both functional and artistic furniture. This foundation tells a story, that of a creator exploring forms, textures and materials to compose a rich and inspiring universe. First copy of a series of 8, it is designed to offer a unique experience, its design allows different sitting positions. It combines a solid sanded wood structure with a high-end leather coating whose drrape resembles a royal trail.</p>  <p> Miniature prototype Armchair throne  <br>A true proof of concept, this miniature prototype was used as a preparatory work in the research process, validating the possibility of sheathing a hull created by a solidified drape. The idea of keeping a natural drape, like a nonchalently thrown skin, in the first copy of our series of 8, is to go through several stages of development: proportions, techniques, finishes. The apparent simplicity of this foundation, the research work necessary to achieve this, all this also makes our specificity: a capacity to unite our know-how, and associated know-how, to propose multi-material pieces of exception.</p>
