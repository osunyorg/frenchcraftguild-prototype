  <p>A graduate of the Boulle School's scissors workshop in Paris, Kim Jude has refined her know-how with renowned artisans in France and abroad. In 2019, she created her own workshop, where she brought together with elegance the worlds of jewellery, lighting and decoration. It combines finely chiseled brass with blown glass, giving birth to both precious and poetic pieces.</p>
