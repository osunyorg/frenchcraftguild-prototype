Trained in cabinetmaking and the art foundry, he draws on his passion for archaeology to reinterpret aesthetic and methodological references in his creations. His projects, whether they are objects or spaces, combine technical rigor, historical research and craft sensitivity.</p><p>Founded in 2023 by Thomas Noui and Victor Robin, cabinetmaker trained at La Bonne Graine, <a href="https://www.instagram.com/zbeul_studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Zbeul Studio <span class="sr-only">(external link)</span></a> requires a unique approach to design, both committed and experimental. Their reflection goes beyond the mere creation of functional objects: it questions how traditions, materials and uses shape our daily environments.</p>
