    <p>Chronolithique II  <br>In  Chronolithique II,  the artist creates a sensitive dialogue between matter and memory. By juxtaposing 420 pellets of sandstone and porcelain in vertical strata, it recomposes a fictitious geological carrot, both an archive of time and a metaphor for the identity of the present. This work questions the trace and the bonds we leave in the thickness of the world. Suspended by a thread, Chronolithic invites to a meditation on the memory and brevity of the materials of living existence, facing geological immensity.</p>
