The two liturgical objects were carved from brass using CNC machining at the MMB company in Normandy, before being electroplated with palladium and subtly satin-finished by microblasting at Bertin Aubert in Paris. Inspired by Gothic architecture, the crown of thorns, and historical sacred objects, this new Eucharistic silverware seems to be animated by a vital force and is the result of a completely new design, both in terms of its design, manufacturing technique, and finish.   <br>CHALICE:  <br> Height: 31 cm  <br> Cup diameter: 10 cm  <br> Base diameter: 15 cm  <br> Material: palladium-plated brass  <br> Weight: 1540 g (Replica displayed in 3D PLA printing, filler, paint, and varnish)  <br> PATEN:  <br> Height: 3 cm  <br> Diameter: 23.2 cm  <br> Material: palladium-plated brass  <br> Weight: 930 g (Replica displayed in 3D PLA printing, filler, paint, and varnish)   </p>  <p> More about Julien Roos' work </p>  <p>  </p>  <p>Instagram</p>  <p>Instagram : https://www.instagram.com/roos.julien/ </p>

  <p>During his graduate degree in product design in 2020, he was awarded the Young Creation Award of the Mobilier national for the design of the table of the Council of Ministers for the Palace of the Elysée, inaugurated in 2022 by the President of the Republic. This distinction allows him to work after his studies in agencies of renowned French designers, and to be one of the artists contributing to the annual charitable sale of the association La Source, founded by Elizabeth and Gérard Garouste. </p><p>Inspired by history, the arts, science, nature and civilizations, Julien develops unique tailor-made projects in collaboration with companies with artisanal and new know-how. In the interest of transmitting our heritage, its ambition is to take part in its evolution in the face of new contemporary challenges through a design approach combining references, extension, symbolic, and innovation.</p>
